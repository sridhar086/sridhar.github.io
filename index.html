<h4>Sr Software Engineer &emsp; Oracle America Inc, Bellevue WA &emsp; Sep 2018 -  Current <br></h4>
<b>Project: Advertising Data Pipelines (March 2023 - Current):</b>><br>
<ul>
  <li>Handle voluminous Kafka stream data with variety of records and make it available for the org. to consume.</li>
  <li>The data pipelines receive 1000’s of records every minute and are processed in OCI spark dataflow.</li>
  <li>The data is made available in both AWS and OCI, while processing happens only in OCI.</li>
  <li>Migrating our workflow from AWS to OCI, setting up new orchestration of pipeline using airflow/argo.</li>
</ul>
<b>Project: Data API/Data Collaboration Platform (July 2021 – March 2023):</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Designed model to facilitate data storage, access, and enforce data lease contracts.</li>
  <li>Data API defines schema, transformation and joins across schema, source and destination location.</li>
  <li>Designed API for data model, entities, and its relationships & persistence.</li>
  <li>Usage of IAM roles/policy to allow limited access to a leased data location and enforce contracts and TTL.</li>
  <li>Designed and built security model for the Data Lease Service with RSA based auth and auto JWT generation.</li>
  <li>Integrated with other systems to effectively manage source data and lease data according to contracts.</li>
</ul>
<b>Project: User Consent Management System (July 2020 – July 2021):</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Opt-out data auditor will be capable of keeping a register of dataset, export opt-outs and trigger alerts to dataset owners and generate periodic reports and keep counts.</li>
  <li>Load testing the service using Apache JMeter for an endpoint that needs to capture few million records.</li>
  <li>Productionizing Apache Pulsar cluster with TLS certs and setting it up on OCI Kubernetes.</li>
</ul>
<b>Project: Dynamic Data Packaging and Delivery Project (Sep 2018 – July 2020):</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Designed and implemented a new data packaging & delivery project to replace an existing batch processing.</li>
  <li>The project saves about $2M/year in computing cost, brought down compute time from 96 hours to 14 hours.</li>
  <li>The different supporting pieces are - Data selection, Data Matching, Data Transformation and Packaging, Data Encryption, Data Compression and Data Delivery.</li>
  <li>Automatically deliver reports and notify the stake holders, clients, and dev team about the deliveries.</li>
  <li>Interacted with the Product team gathering requirement for the system & drafting functional specification. Train the operations team with the new system and oversee on-time resolutions of support tickets.</li>
</ul>
<b>Tech Stack: Java/Spring Boot/Kubernetes.</b><br>
<b>Data Processing: Apache Spark/Qubole/AWS.</b><br>
<b>Job Orchestration: Luigi/Apache Airflow.</b><br>
Migration of all our CI/CD pipelines from Jenkins to Gitlab. Replicate all the functionalities of existing pipeline. Perform unit testing and integration testing to seamlessly integrate with other existing systems.<br>
Coordinate with other teams/pods to enhance design/development and support cross-team projects.<br>

<h4>Software Developer &emsp; Red Hen Systems, Fort Collins CO &emsp; Nov 2016 -  Current <br></h4>
– Led a Field Report creation project for Anadarko on C#/.Net to view and publish survey data.<br>
– The paper-based forms were converted to digital application based on a .Net Windows platform capable of data
entry, sketching with stylus or touch pad and attaching photos.<br>
– The tool is capable of formatting the data in the pdf, resize images/customer sketch, publish data to a database
and send an email with the pdf as an attachment.<br>
– Responsible for development of IsWhere, Media Geo-Tagger softwares - C#/.Net/WPF/Forms.<br>
– Introduced online licensing & management system for all our software products reducing manual effort.<br>
– Improved the software by adding tools to clip videos, modified UI, provided multiple file compatibility.<br>
– Batch automation process for ETL workflow – Data extraction, processing, analytics, and delivery.<br>
– Worked on GIS projects for various oil & natural gas companies, universities, and government agencies.<br>
– Develop new features and maintain IsWhere and Media Geo-Tagger software, based on C#/.Net.<br>
– Batch file automation of video files copying, decoding, creation of CSVs/XMLs, ArcPy processing (.shp). Reduced time taken from 2 working days to just 4 hours which is a 200x improvement.<br>
– Introduced support for Flexible & Interoperable Data Transfer (.fit) files for Garmin VIRB’s.<br>
– Optimization of Python codes to process several hundred thousand spatially referenced data points for data analysis of methane PPM, wind vector data to create KMLs. <br>
– Maintain ArcGIS server - MS SQL server and the front end client to display GIS results.<br>


<h4>Grad Student Researcher  &emsp; Computer Networking Research Lab, CSU &emsp; Feb 2015 -  may 2017 <br></h4>
<b>Capture & Reconstruction of the Topology of Undirected Graphs from Partial Coordinates - A Matrix Completion based Approach</b>

- Used the principles of low rank matrix completion to capture and reconstruct the topology of undirected graphs. <br>
- Topology reconstructed using two different measurements,<br>
a) Shortest hop distances from nodes to a set of nodes called as anchors<br>
b) Shortest hop distances between any two random node pairs<br>
- Applied on Wireless Sensor Networks and Social Network Datasets (Facebook, Collaboration and Email networks)<br>
- Compressed representation of Social Networks<br>
- Utilized the extended Robust Principal Component Analysis [Randy et. al.] for predicting the unknown entries of low ranked matrix.<br>

<b>Wireless Sensor Networks</b>
- Spatial Analytics on Wireless Sensor Networks and GPS free localization using topological coordinates [Jayasumana et. al]. <br>
- Created new 3D test networks for WSNs. Number of nodes ranges from 500 to 1600.<br>
- Reconstructed the topology of WSNs with only 2% to 5% of coordinates from distance matrix<br>

<b>Social Networks</b>
- Analysis of the social network properties,<br>
a) The three test networks denote three different clustering - between 0 and 1 (0.2379 to 0.6048) (Start to Clique)<br>
b) Very different Avg. path length (2.55 to 6.048) and diameter (5 to 18)<br>
c) Number of nodes vary between 750 to 4200<br>
- Reconstructed the topology of the social networks within 1 hop distance error with only 1% of the coordinates.<br>
- Used Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Networkx), Gephi for the implementation<br>
